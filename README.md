# IvueDomain


The repository contains an ASP.​NET Core + Vue.js CRUD operation project. 
The Project runs on ASP.NET Core 6.0 and is created by Vue CLI 5.0.



## Prerequisites

* [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) >= 6.0
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) >= 8.9
* [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) >= 5.0
* Your favourite editor (I prefer [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)), or VS code

## Clone the starter with default configuration

* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/nilesh-patil25/IvueDomain.git`

## Set the startup project

1) In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution name and select Set Startup Project. Change the startup project from Single startup project to Multiple startup projects. Select Start for each project’s action.

2) Next, select the backend project and move it above the frontend, so that it starts up first.

## Run the application

You have three choices when it comes to how you prefer to run the app. You can either use the command line or the build-in run command.

### 1. Using the command line

* Run the .NET application using `dotnet run`

### 2. Using the built-in run command

* Run the application in Visual Studio 2022 by hitting `F5` or run in VS code

> It will take some time during the first run to download all client side dependencies.

Browse to [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5000) for ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue app or browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for Vue app only.
